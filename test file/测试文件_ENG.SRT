1
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,971
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

2
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,725
Just you wait. It's my turn now.

3
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,282
Let's end it now.

4
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,621
No!

5
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,674
Do-hwi.

6
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,218
Wake up, Do-hwi.

7
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,427
Stay with me, Do-hwi.

8
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,679
What's the matter?

9
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,099
You wanted to end things.

10
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:09,963
Mr. Hwang.

11
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,392
I guess you missed me after all.

12
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,394
First,

13
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,981
let me kill her. Then I'll compliment you.

14
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,653
I thought we'd be together forever.

15
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,238
What are you doing?

16
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:40,952
If you're adamant about leaving me, then there's nothing I can do.

17
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,581
But you're too precious for me

18
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,375
to just hand over to them.

19
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,754
Damn it.

20
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,382
So?

21
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:59,846
Are you going to kill me and then consume me?

22
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,223
Just think that you'll be living inside me.

23
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,185
Thanks for your power in advance.

24
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,665
Do-hwi.

25
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,967
She said she was nearby.

26
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,720
There!

27
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,182
Ha-na!

28
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,604
Ha-na!

29
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,856
Ha-na!

30
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,110
Please save him.

31
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,903
Please save Do-hwi!

32
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,614
What happened?

33
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,563
So now there's conflict between those two.

34
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,232
Mr. Hwang and that woman, Gelly.

35
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,901
By the way, Mr. Hwang, I mean…

36
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:19,902
Pil-gwang, was it?

37
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:24,282
Isn't it a good thing that he and Gelly are fighting?

38
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,992
Let one foe take the other out.

39
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,536
No. It may seem favorable right now.

40
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:33,249
But if he kills her and absorbs her power,

41
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,294
he may become too powerful for us to summon.

42
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:40,089
Ha-na couldn't locate them, could she?

43
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,968
It was a dangerous situation. She was up against two evil spirits.

44
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,013
Had she not used psychokinesis,

45
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,348
she likely wouldn't have escaped with Do-hwi.

46
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:53,644
We searched the entire city.

47
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:58,024
So why couldn't you sniff them out?

48
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:01,819
I'm doing my utmost best.

49
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,237
What's wrong with my nose?

50
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,282
Is it still not working properly?

51
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,034
Tell me.

52
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:11,037
You're cleaning your nostrils regularly, right?

53
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,623
You bet. I even plucked out my nose hairs.

54
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,002
-Hey. -Yes?

55
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,879
Why did you do that?

56
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,215
Don't you know you need them to smell properly?

57
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,966
-Seriously? -Hey, let me see.

58
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,551
How much you pluck?

59
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,386
-All of them. -They're all gone.

60
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,139
I thought the nose hairs were getting in the way.

61
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,767
He'll be okay.

62
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,604
Let's keep an eye on him and take him home before it gets late.

63
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:38,981
Thank you, Ms. Chu.

64
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:47,615
As for his memory, I erased all memories of Gelly.

65
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,119
But won't he be flustered when he wakes up?

66
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,829
He won't remember anything.

67
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,207
I'll try my best to sort that out.

68
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,339
So he won't be startled when he wakes up.

69
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,844
I'll settle everything.

70
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,389
Everything?

71
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,804
Ha-na.

72
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,223
Do-hwi, are you awake?

73
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,311
No, you can't get up yet. Lie down.

74
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,897
What happened?

75
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:02,815
Where am--

76
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,236
What happened to your face?

77
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,074
My memory is vague.

78
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,579
I remember that you were in danger.

79
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,166
You're right.

80
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,919
You saved me.

81
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,296
You are pretty healthy.

82
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:28,883
You just…

83
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:31,928
got into…

84
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,847
a small accident.

85
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,558
You collapsed while trying to save me.

86
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,354
Thankfully, it happened near my place, so I brought you here.

87
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,773
There was an accident?

88
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,736
Do-hwi, remember that restaurant…

89
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,699
that we wanted to go to, but couldn't?

90
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,951
Yes.

91
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,161
I'd like to go there.

92
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,996
Really?

93
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,959
You booked tickets to a play too on the day.

94
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,085
Right?

95
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,047
-I'll book them this time. Let's watch it. -No, let me.

96
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,050
Are we really going together?

97
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,972
I can't believe you're saying that.

98
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,227
It just feels so surreal.

99
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,148
Meeting you…

100
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,278
and seeing you smile once again.

101
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,574
I actually prayed every day…

102
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,077
that I'd meet you again.

103
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,455
It was a short time, but I…

104
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,293
I was extremely happy thanks to you.

105
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,711
Okay.

106
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,339
You'll feel better after taking a nap.

107
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,387
You won't be in danger because of me anymore.

108
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,727
Thank you for everything.

109
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,074
Damn it.

110
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,120
Damn it.

111
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,166
Damn it!

112
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,335
Hwang Pil-gwang.

113
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,632
What should I do with you so I can stop feeling shitty?

114
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,431
Damn it.

115
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,520
I can't believe that bitch became useful.

116
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,284
She rose from the dead.

117
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,915
That means she got her power then.

118
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:35,212
What did she accept to come back to life?

119
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,550
Damn it.

120
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:02,990
I won so many.

121
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,778
DO RE MI FA SOL LA TI DO CLASSIC PIANO ACADEMY

122
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,312
Mr. Park.

123
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,649
Hello.

124
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,193
Mr. Park, I practiced a ton.

125
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,695
No, I practiced more than you.

126
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,243
I practiced more than 1,000 times.

127
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,953
I practiced more than 2,000 times.

128
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,746
-No way! -That many times?

129
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:39,587
Gosh.

130
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,716
Is Ha-na still not here yet?

131
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,093
Breakfast is almost ready.

132
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,012
I'm worried about her.

133
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,139
It won't be easy to forget him.

134
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:55,144
She looked so happy when she was with him.

135
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,438
She seemed to like him a lot too.

136
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,480
Right.

137
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,277
What are you wearing?

138
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,239
Are you going somewhere? Why are you all dolled up this morning?

139
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,949
I'm not.

140
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:13,996
This is how I normally dress. You don't know me at all.

141
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,499
By the way, where's Ha-na?

142
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:18,918
Jeez.

143
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,086
Gosh, you're savage.

144
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,463
Look at you.

145
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,341
Do you take her sadness as an opportunity?

146
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,843
You're more calculating than I thought.

147
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:28,802
You are.

148
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,970
Jeok-bong!

149
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:30,888
What is it?

150
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,016
Take that off this instant.

151
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:34,934
Why?

152
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,102
I'm worried it'll remind Ha-na of Do-hwi.

153
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,187
Those musical notes…

154
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,106
-Hurry. -Would she really, though?

155
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,818
Ms. Chu.

156
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,030
Let's not eat that today.

157
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,907
Why not?

158
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,201
Doraji and Do-hwi start with a D.

159
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,870
That's not good. I'll take it away.

160
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,872
Do you really have to?

161
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,125
Then should we take this away too?

162
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,835
It looks like a keyboard.

163
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,171
-No. -Take that away.

164
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,425
In that case, why are we having chicken soup?

165
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,594
It'll make her think of the dish we had that day.

166
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,553
-No. -You're right.

167
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,471
Sorry, I'm late.

168
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,847
-Hey! -She's here!

169
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:14,848
Hey!

170
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,814
What's wrong with you guys?

171
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,401
-My back is killing me. -Are you okay?

172
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,819
-I'll get changed. -Okay.

173
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,320
What's wrong with your back?

174
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,238
-Gosh. -What is it?

175
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,240
Did someone come in?

176
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:32,992
Hurry!

177
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,120
Hey, take them away.

178
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,255
Didn't you say we were having chicken soup today?

179
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,717
Well, you see…

180
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,887
Mo-tak has been craving ramyeon since this morning.

181
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,264
That's why. Right?

182
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,598
Why did you…

183
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,850
Right.

184
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,563
There are days when you wake up and you crave ramyeon.

185
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,148
Right?

186
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,983
What? Right.

187
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,317
By the way,

188
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,903
-the air feels so fresh this morning. -It sure does.

189
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,406
On a day like this, we should listen to some music.

190
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,741
-Yes. -Yes.

191
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,577
-Let's listen to some music while we eat. -Right.

192
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,162
Cue the music.

193
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,707
Turn that off!

194
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,214
That's enough. I'm okay.

195
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,008
Don't lie.

196
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,552
-When it comes to love-- -It's not like that.

197
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,055
Do-hwi will be okay too.

198
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,222
And I'll be okay.

199
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,267
So don't worry about me.

200
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,896
If you're really okay,

201
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,815
-then can we have the chicken-- -Come on.

202
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:52,696
Right.

203
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,615
The evil spirits' hideout…

204
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,410
Were you able to read something?

205
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,205
It wasn't clear.

206
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,749
But their hideout…

207
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,254
looked a little too clean and tidy.

208
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,424
It felt like a luxurious resort or a hotel.

209
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,153
I don't smell anything.

210
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,323
There are hotels elsewhere too.

211
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,575
Let's check them one by one.

212
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,411
One by one?

213
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,372
While Mo-tak looks for Lee Chung-jae,

214
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:47,084
we need to look for Hwang Pil-gwang.

215
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,424
That lunatic is a monster.

216
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,094
He's a crazy monster.

217
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,596
That I can agree.

218
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:04,518
But why did that monster come looking for you?

219
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:10,399
Weren't you Lee Chung-jae's medical examiner?

220
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:16,697
Did Ma Ju-seok come for you…

221
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,700
because of Lee Chung-jae?

222
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:26,331
That's the only thing you two have in common.

223
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,374
I don't know.

224
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,626
I don't know anything!

225
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,671
Please…

226
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,883
Please capture that monster.

227
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,094
Please help me.

228
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,054
You're still playing dumb?

229
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,850
I know you forged the autopsy result!

230
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,561
I know that Lee Chung-jae…

231
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,023
is still alive.

232
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:02,826
You also took part in creating that monster.

233
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,329
Do you know that?

234
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,090
Hi.

235
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,928
How much is their rate again?

236
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,263
It's 200,000 won per hour, sir.

237
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,641
Jeez, the minimum wage has skyrocketed.

238
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,975
Don't you agree?

239
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,644
Do you guys even pay taxes?

240
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,981
I think they'll do a better job at losing the cops than our boys did.

241
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:37,069
You idiot. We don't have any boys.

242
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,321
They've all been either killed or arrested.

243
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,822
If you did your job properly

244
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,700
I wouldn't have to waste my money on these foreigners.

245
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,035
I'm sorry, sir.

246
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,292
I'm already mad that I had to spend my money elsewhere.

247
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,377
Gosh.

248
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,172
Hey, how is plan B going?

249
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,759
It's going well. All we need now is for you to tell us the date.

250
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,177
Ga Mo-tak, was it?

251
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,847
I should get rid of the scumbag who got in my way.

252
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:06,807
Damn it.

253
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,809
What? Here.

254
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,603
Hey, Lim Jae-youl.

255
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,814
Long time, no see.

256
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,649
Good job. You may go.

257
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:17,651
Sir.

258
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,613
Hey, how have you been?

259
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:26,243
Damn it. It must be rough for you.

260
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,996
It really wasn't me, sir.

261
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:32,958
I don't know that cop or why that lady kept following me.

262
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,876
Please spare me.

263
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,546
I ran away from the site by accident.

264
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,630
I know.

265
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,924
I know, okay?

266
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,051
I know you weren't digging your own grave.

267
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,928
You wouldn't do that.

268
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,221
-Right? -You're right, sir.

269
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,389
I've been loyal--

270
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,307
But still,

271
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:52,311
you have to clean up your own mess.

272
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,314
Sorry?

273
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,695
He left the door unlocked.

274
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,061
GRANDMA'S DEATH ANNIVERSARY

275
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,335
Why are you here?

276
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,961
Why are you back?

277
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,546
Your house is so messy.

278
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:06,885
Leave this instant.

279
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,428
Gosh.

280
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,387
Jeez.

281
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,353
You must think I'm a joke since you can fight.

282
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,730
But do you see this knife scar?

283
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,607
I can go haywire when I see red.

284
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,691
Do you know that?

285
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,152
Please.

286
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,695
Please stay alive.

287
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,656
Please.

288
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,288
Let me see.

289
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,169
It was my first time, so it still left a scar.

290
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,089
I thought I had gotten rid of it all.

291
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:46,716
What?

292
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,302
Aren't you hungry? Sit down.

293
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:50,887
You should go.

294
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,016
INCENSE STICKS

295
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,646
Is today the anniversary of your grandmother's death?

296
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,042
Here.

297
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,588
Gosh, this is unlike you.

298
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,972
Gosh, that's refreshing.

299
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,859
We don't need all this food.

300
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:51,239
The only thing my grandma needs is makgeolli.

301
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,118
Do you miss her?

302
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,794
Have this.

303
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,588
What's wrong with you? Are you nuts?

304
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,716
Have some food and eat with her.

305
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,471
It's tasty, right?

306
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,232
How did you get that scar…

307
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,276
on your stomach?

308
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,403
It's obvious.

309
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,030
I was in a knife fight.

310
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:40,789
A kid I know was stabbed while saving someone.

311
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,877
Why would he be an idiot and do such a thing?

312
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,547
His body probably reacted before he could even think.

313
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,259
He had a kind heart.

314
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,221
So?

315
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,515
What is he doing now?

316
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,309
He's probably dead.

317
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,771
Nosy people tend to die early.

318
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:05,939
You're wrong.

319
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,358
He's alive and well.

320
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:16,074
Life isn't all that unfair.

321
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:21,204
There are more good people than bad ones.

322
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,498
But you just don't know that.

323
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,209
To live…

324
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:32,841
Goodness. What's wrong with me?

325
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,392
Don't…

326
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,478
Don't tell me you…

327
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,275
I'm sorry, lady.

328
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,194
But I need to live.

329
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,616
Why did you have to come back here?

330
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,879
Hello.

331
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,715
It's me, sir.

332
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,929
We're ready.

333
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,806
We'll finish off that cop too.

334
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,933
Then, we leave.

335
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:24,893
Yes, sir.

336
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,646
Unbelievable.

337
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,024
He wants me to cut their rate.

338
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,945
Are you awake, lady?

339
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,374
Who's that cop you're close to?

340
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,294
-Mo-tak? -Yes, Ga Mo-tak.

341
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,505
Tell him to come here right now.

342
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,799
Then I'll spare you.

343
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,303
You want him to come here?

344
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:03,098
You heard me, hurry up.

345
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,350
They charge us by the hour.

346
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,060
It's a hefty sum.

347
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,730
Are you sure?

348
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,776
You'll regret it.

349
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,197
Call him.

350
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,582
-Hey, Ms. Chu. -Mo-tak, it's me.

351
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,295
-I need you to come here. -Here?

352
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,715
Where exactly are you? I'm busy searching all the golf courses.

353
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:41,678
Yes, I know. But I need you to come here.

354
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,054
It's an emergency.

355
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:01,948
Mo-tak.

356
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,549
Come on. That's enough.

357
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,441
Come on. Why are you doing this?

358
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,445
Why are you causing a scene in our country?

359
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,989
No, put that down.

360
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:45,283
No. Go over there, okay?

361
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,619
I get that it's hard to make money, but still.

362
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,168
-What are you? -What's that?

363
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,601
Hey, stay back!

364
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,187
Move an inch and she's dead!

365
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,523
So? Are you going to rest some more?

366
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,317
I'm good. I've rested enough.

367
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,658
I told you that you'd regret it.

368
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,211
What are you? You're not human, right?

369
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:41,422
It's scumbags like you who aren't humans.

370
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,220
This will probably kill you, right?

371
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,227
Put your hands up, you scumbags.

372
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,438
-Put them up. -Put your hands up.

373
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,899
Listen to me.

374
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:05,071
Did Lim Jae-youl hand you over to them?

375
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:09,200
I guess it's easy to turn evil, but not the other way around.

376
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,120
You're wrong.

377
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,497
This is a blessing in disguise.

378
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,417
I think he repaid your kindness in a way.

379
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,127
What do you mean?

380
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,713
Put your hands up properly!

381
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:28,386
We should take him to Lee Chung-jae.

382
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,399
It's not my fault.

383
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:46,154
It's her fate that she crossed paths with me.

384
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,425
Who are you?

385
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,218
I was right.

386
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,807
Lee Chung-jae is a dead man.

387
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,398
You delivered Lee Chung-jae's money.

388
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,374
Lee Chung-jae…

389
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,335
Where is he?

390
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,756
An abandoned golf course?

391
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:51,302
He closed down a perfectly fine golf course and is going to town.

392
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,428
Damn it.

393
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,764
PRESIDENT LEE

394
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,103
You know what you need to say, right?

395
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,400
Hello, sir.

396
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,402
Why the hell are you taking so long?

397
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,737
What is it? Is there an issue?

398
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,616
No, sir. We got rid of them.

399
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,494
We're almost there.

400
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,001
Why the long face, you punk.

401
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,920
We're going there to save him.

402
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,214
What? You shouldn't do that.

403
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,258
What do you mean?

404
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,552
I'll be his first target if he lives.

405
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:36,973
Why don't you just kill him off this time around?

406
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,601
Jeez. This is unbelievable.

407
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,603
Jeez.

408
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,773
-Please kill him. -Shut it, you idiot!

409
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,861
What's with his voice?

410
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,739
Damn it. He has no patience or spirit.

411
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,659
He better have reduced their rates.

412
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,121
Calm down, Chung-jae.

413
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,631
What? Damn it.

414
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,302
What are you doing?

415
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:16,763
Sir?

416
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,806
Why aren't you retrieving it?

417
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,060
You gave me the wrong club and see what happened.

418
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,270
But sir, how can I go in…

419
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,272
I'll bring you a new ball.

420
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:27,440
Damn it!

421
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,318
Is everyone out to annoy me today?

422
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,944
Do you know how much that costs?

423
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,198
It costs 5,000 won!

424
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,368
Hey, lady. Go get the ball.

425
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,746
Go get my ball!

426
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:42,955
I'm sorry, sir.

427
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,791
You're sorry?

428
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,292
Do you think that'll cut it?

429
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,419
This won't do.

430
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,547
Hey, come here.

431
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,509
I'll make a hole-in-one with your head, so stay still.

432
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,843
-I was wrong, sir. -No.

433
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,387
You did nothing wrong. Just do better from now on.

434
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,306
This is perfect.

435
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,183
Hey, give me a ball.

436
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,810
Nice. Okay, put your head down.

437
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,686
Stay still.

438
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,939
This is perfect. Stay still.

439
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,816
This is good.

440
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,988
Who the hell was that?

441
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,451
What's going on?

442
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,328
What the hell?

443
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:23,996
Who the hell is he?

444
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,582
Who is he?

445
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,585
I think he's that prisoner who escaped.

446
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:30,962
-What? -The one on the news.

447
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,965
The prisoner? The one who killed Mr. Park?

448
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,425
-Yes. -Ma Ju-seok, was it?

449
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:39,137
Even the police couldn't find me and that guy did.

450
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,346
Hey!

451
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,306
It's nice to meet you, Ma Ju-seok!

452
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,566
You already killed your wife's murderer,

453
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,943
Why the hell would you bother coming here?

454
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,027
I--

455
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,029
Come on. Do your money's worth.

456
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,323
He doesn't have fond feelings for me. Hurry…

457
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,428
All right!

458
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,598
I'll give you anything you want, okay? One billion? Two billion?

459
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,808
Fine, half. I'll give you half, okay?

460
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,395
Thanks for being alive,

461
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,648
so that I can kill you with my own hands.

462
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,074
Stop!

463
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,709
Help me.

464
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,465
-Mo-tak! -Ms. Chu!

465
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,217
Take Lee Chung-jae with you and go!

466
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,426
Okay.

467
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,786
You bastard.

468
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,204
Come with me, you bastard.

469
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,883
Get in, you bastard.

470
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,500
Get these off.

471
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,545
Get these off!

472
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,172
I can't do that.

473
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:26,470
It's unlike me to let go of an evil spirit.

474
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:36,981
You knew that Lee Chung-jae was alive.

475
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:41,110
You knew that Min-ji's killer

476
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,321
was still alive and well, but hid it from me.

477
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,199
And now, you're getting in my way?

478
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,535
We must stop you!

479
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,621
We must before the evil spirit

480
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,085
consumes you whole.

481
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,423
Stop here, Ma Ju-seok.

482
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:07,678
Lee Chung-jae will receive his punishment.

483
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:15,061
Die!

484
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:22,026
Kill everyone!

485
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,245
What are you doing, Ma Ju-seok?

486
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,331
You need to kill him!

487
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,217
And what makes you the ones to punish him?

488
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,012
You've lost your chance.

489
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,740
Come on, lady.

490
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,909
Drive properly, will you?

491
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,793
Ma Ju-seok, no!

492
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,924
Go away!

493
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:27,842
Please go away!

494
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,821
I'm not done with you just yet!

495
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:08,966
Go away!

496
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:36,911
Mo-tak!

497
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:38,913
-Mo-tak. -Mo-tak!

498
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,210
Ma Ju-seok did this?

499
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,378
How could he?

500
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,516
How pathetic.

501
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,310
You let Lee Chung-jae go.

502
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:06,774
I told you to get rid of those who got in your way.

503
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:11,820
You must kill them all, Ma Ju-seok!

504
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,836
They could care less about my pain.

505
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,423
They were unhappy that I had this power.

506
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,301
You'll soon realize that as well.

507
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,220
If we want our revenge

508
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,847
we'll need to kill them.

509
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,732
Hold still. Don't move.

510
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,068
Your bones are shattered.

511
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:53,862
What do we do?

512
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,657
It looks as if a tiger bit him.

513
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,994
-Jeok-bong. -Yes?

514
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,078
I'm not dead.

515
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,290
You look so

516
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,333
ugly right now--

517
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:20,723
It's done.

518
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,853
Thank you, Ms. Chu.

519
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:32,151
I wonder what happened to Lee Chung-jae.

520
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,571
He's probably lying low again.

521
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:39,074
He's one lucky scumbag.

522
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:45,247
He ran away when Ma Ju-seok and Mo-tak were fighting each other.

523
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,793
But it's a relief, isn't it?

524
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:54,882
-Ma Ju-seok didn't get to kill him. -You're right.

525
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,426
It's a shame that we lost both of them.

526
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:00,220
But we stopped Ma Ju-seok from committing another murder.

527
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,222
Let's not be discouraged.

528
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:07,811
Also, Ma Ju-seok was only hostile toward the individual he resented.

529
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,772
That's not guaranteed though.

530
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:14,234
His rage has probably grown even bigger now.

531
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:19,740
And that means the evil spirit has become stronger.

532
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,793
GRANDFATHER

533
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,711
Come on.

534
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,338
Jeez.

535
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:37,716
I promise that we'll go see him tomorrow.

536
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,553
You haven't been acting out lately. What's gotten into you?

537
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,222
Grandma.

538
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,015
Hey.

539
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,727
Call my darling to come, will you?

540
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,604
Hey, come on.

541
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,231
Let's go inside now.

542
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:53,982
He said he'd visit tomorrow.

543
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:55,776
Grandma.

544
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,241
Mr. Ma…

545
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,245
won't be coming anymore.

546
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,664
Hey, Mun.

547
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,500
So you shouldn't be acting this way. Stop.

548
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,007
No.

549
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,635
He said he'd come.

550
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,637
He said he would.

551
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,432
He told me so.

552
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,392
That's enough.

553
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:30,936
I miss that kind man

554
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,356
as much as you do.

555
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:41,447
But Mr. Ma won't be coming anymore.

556
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,284
So stop.

557
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:51,623
We need to stop, Grandma.

558
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:20,652
After all,

559
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,490
it seems you've failed to kill Lee Chung-jae.

560
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:33,499
I'm sure you've finally realized who was being truthful,

561
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:38,587
who you should kill first for your revenge,

562
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,131
and if you don't give up,

563
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,761
that they will kill you first.

564
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:51,934
I want to know how to get rid of them.

565
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,363
Is that why you came to see me?

566
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,408
You want to fight against them?

567
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:10,118
Yes.

568
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,871
You know something.

569
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:18,001
You wouldn't have fought against them if there wasn't a way.

570
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:24,299
This fight will only end once one party dies.

571
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,177
It's either them

572
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,471
or us.

573
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:36,603
So do you really have the guts to kill them?

574
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:42,192
You even spared that worthless doctor who forged

575
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:44,319
Lee Chung-jae's death.

576
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:50,492
Do you really think a soft person like you…

577
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:56,123
can kill those who were once like family to you?

578
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,084
Ma Ju-seok.

579
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,005
How am I supposed to believe that?

580
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,551
Like you said,

581
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,471
I have no choice now.

582
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,393
I must see through my revenge.

583
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:30,657
I, Na Jeok-bong,

584
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:35,120
believe that a true Counter should be of help when his colleagues are troubled!

585
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:40,292
With that determination in mind, I must sniff them out once again.

586
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:45,756
Jeok-bong,

587
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:48,425
what are you doing right now?

588
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,010
Jeok-bong!

589
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:56,892
Mo-tak, have you seen Jeok-bong?

590
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:59,519
Jeok-bong? No, I haven't.

591
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,022
-Mun. -Yes?

592
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:03,899
Do you want some coffee?

593
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,275
That was random.

594
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:07,569
I know it's unexpected.

595
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,072
I normally ask others for coffee.

596
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,492
This is the first time I'm making coffee for you.

597
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:16,995
I rarely serve coffee to others.

598
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,095
All right.

599
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:35,722
Have some.

600
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,813
It's nutty.

601
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:45,107
-Right? It's nutty and tasty. -It is.

602
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,025
All right.

603
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:53,615
There must be a reason why I made that for you, right?

604
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:55,784
Excuse me?

605
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,162
Huh?

606
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:06,253
Mo-tak, you're overexerting yourself today.

607
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,587
You need some rest.

608
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,089
You're wrong.

609
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:12,759
We always fought evil spirits, no matter our condition.

610
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:14,886
Blast me.

611
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:24,855
Are you okay?

612
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,231
-What's that? -Nothing.

613
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:29,192
Let's go. Do it harder!

614
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:32,070
Ma Ju-seok was much stronger than that.

615
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:34,781
-But Mo-tak… -Mun.

616
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,283
I represent strength.

617
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,827
If my psychokinesis won't work,

618
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,288
then I should at least be able to withstand his.

619
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,539
I got this.

620
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,124
I can do it.

621
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,877
Blast me again, Mun.

622
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,131
I'll go harder this time.

623
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:56,970
Mun.

624
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:58,805
Gosh, that was too much.

625
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,808
Mun.

626
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,310
Goodness.

627
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,462
Did you see that?

628
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:31,838
Did you see that?

629
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,508
Did you see how I withstood your psychokinesis?

630
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,052
And then, I hit you.

631
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,220
Did you see that?

632
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,429
I did.

633
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,181
Mo-tak, see?

634
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:44,476
Use your brain if you don't have the strength.

635
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:52,692
Mo-tak,

636
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,488
I told you to never let your guard down.

637
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:58,573
Right, I shouldn't.

638
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,703
Ma Ju-seok would've attacked you more ferociously than I did.

639
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:12,212
Have you acknowledged him as a true evil spirit now?

640
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,678
I have no other choice.

641
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,223
If I want to protect everyone,

642
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,726
I must stay grounded and summon him at all costs.

643
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,604
Before it's too late.

644
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:30,814
Hey!

645
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,567
Do you think you're in this alone?

646
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,986
Didn't you see me just now?

647
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,780
You can trust me.

648
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:42,993
I'm no longer the Ga Mo-tak I used to be.

649
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:47,330
I smell something in Jungjin 2-ga!

650
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,623
What?

651
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,793
I've never smelled this intense smell before!

652
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,753
Intense smell?

653
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,547
That's right.

654
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,383
I'm smelling something near the hotels we searched!

655
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,096
But this smell doesn't belong to Mr. Hwang.

656
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,933
It's Ma Ju-seok. He set foot.

657
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,644
-Where, Ha-na? -A hotel near Jungjin 2-ga.

658
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,438
He's going inside.

659
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,480
A hotel?

660
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:52,354
-Jeok-bong. -What?

661
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,815
I swear he came in here.

662
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,525
But the smell is gone now.

663
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:58,944
It's gone?

664
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,236
Yes.

665
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,237
-Jeok-bong. -Yes?

666
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,406
What about Mr. Hwang? Can you smell him?

667
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,785
No, I don't smell anything.

668
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:08,203
Hold on.

669
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:11,456
Ha-na.

670
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:22,008
He definitely pressed the top floor button.

671
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:32,686
Is this the tallest hotel in Jungjin?

672
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:34,312
Yes.

673
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:38,233
We'll see the entire city from the top.

674
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,867
What's the matter?

675
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:50,036
The smell.

676
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,872
The smell is back.

677
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,918
It's the same smell from before.

678
00:54:57,002 --> 00:55:00,046
It smells similar to fermented soybeans.

679
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,256
Out of the blue?

680
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:03,591
The smell vanished, then reappeared?

681
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:07,303
And…

682
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,182
there's another smell.

683
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,352
I smell Mr. Hwang.

684
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:16,146
Do you mean those two are together?

685
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:18,064
Yes, I'm sure of it.

686
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,524
We're getting closer…

687
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,862
to both of them!

688
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:29,034
The height.

689
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:32,287
That's why the smell disappeared.

690
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:36,207
Jeok-bong could only smell within a limited distance and height.

691
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,210
We couldn't find Mr. Hwang because he was here all along.

692
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,364
I'm sure this is it.

693
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,660
I can't tell which direction since it's reeking so much.

694
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:15,705
It's one of these.

695
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,502
Mun, summon the territory first.

696
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:21,586
Okay.

697
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:33,473
What's wrong?

698
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,434
Ms. Chu, it's just that…

699
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,897
I summoned the territory, but I can't see it.

700
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:41,981
What do you mean?

701
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,567
You summoned it but you can't see it all of a sudden?

702
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:08,424
It's not that you can't summon it, Mun. It just doesn't reach that high.

703
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:16,057
It doesn't reach?

704
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,433
You must get out of there!

705
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:21,396
You can't catch the evil spirits without the territory!

706
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:22,856
Hurry!

707
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,233
Hold on.

708
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:28,027
Jeok-bong wasn't the only one whose power was limited?

709
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:31,197
There is a limit to the territory as well?

710
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,503
Hwang Pil-gwang.

711
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:55,263
So I really don't see it.

712
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,141
What you call…

713
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:01,728
the "territory", that you summon.

714
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:06,816
You need it so much

715
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,652
yet you can't have it here.

716
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,238
On the other hand,

717
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:14,949
we don't need it.

718
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:17,160
We?

719
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,263
So you've come all this way.

720
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,766
You followed me here.

721
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:42,477
I'm glad you're here.

722
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:44,729
This will be…

723
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,525
your gravesite.

724
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:51,861
What do we do now?

725
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,571
There's no territory here.

726
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,949
I'll take Ma Ju-seok.

727
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,617
We'll take Hwang Pil-gwang.

728
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:27,063
Ha-na.

729
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:28,898
-Get up. -Ha-na.

730
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,218
I don't need the territory.

731
00:59:57,802 --> 01:00:01,639
I'm going to put an end to you and that bastard Hwang Pil-gwang today.

732
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:04,726
That's right, Mun. There's nothing we can do about this.

733
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:07,770
Neither of us will regret this.

734
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:55,712
Mun!

735
01:01:58,464 --> 01:01:59,966
No.

736
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:02,570
What's wrong?

737
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:05,072
Surprised to see an unexpected guest?

738
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:11,829
Hold still.

739
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:26,052
I knew it.

740
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,595
You had it too.

741
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:30,723
A moment of rebirth.

742
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:54,664
I'm not powerful enough to kill you.

743
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,295
But how about this?

744
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:04,924
What if I erased the memory

745
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:07,885
of your rebirth?

746
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:16,519
What'll happen once the power

747
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:18,896
you've acquired

748
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:21,315
disappears?

749
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,618
No!

750
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,203
Mun!

751
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:36,998
Mun!

752
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:00,563
Mun, stay with me!

753
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:01,731
Mun!

754
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,737
Mun!

755
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:21,334
What have you done?

756
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,884
It would've been a waste!

757
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:33,387
How could I let you take his power?

758
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:08,566
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

759
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:12,069
So Mun is in a coma.

760
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,947
Please open your eyes, Mun.

761
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:16,949
His memory is completely gone.

762
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:20,745
I should at least consume their souls.

763
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:23,456
We need to show him that he doesn't need to protect us

764
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:26,500
and that we can protect him.

765
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:29,420
How does it feel to be attacked in the dark?

766
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:31,005
Do you think this is the end?

767
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:32,590
Ji Cheong-sin?

768
01:07:32,673 --> 01:07:35,259
You need to return to everyone who's waiting for you!

769
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:36,677
You're not alone, Mun.

770
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:39,597
Believe in all the moments that we spent together.

771
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:46,645
